# Introduction

Invasive mucormycosis, caused primarily by *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, and *Lichtheimia* species of the order Mucorales, is a life-threatening infection that has increased in incidence over the past two decades, predominantly affecting immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus [@skiada2025]. Characterized by aggressive angioinvasion and tissue necrosis, mucormycosis carries mortality rates of 40-80% depending on infection site, diagnostic and treatment delays, feasibility of surgical debridement, and host immune recovery [@sigera2023a; @jeong2019]. Current guidelines recommend initial therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) until clinical stabilization, followed by step-down to posaconazole or isavuconazole [@cornely2019].

Due to the aggressiveness of the infection and the reduced *in vitro* susceptibility of Mucorales compared with *Aspergillus* species, higher L-AMB doses (\>5 mg/kg/day) are frequently administered during acute infection to achieve rapid tissue drug concentrations and limit fungal dissemination [@lewis2012]. Although some animal models support this high-dose strategy [@lewis2010], prospective trials [@lanternier2015; @spellberg2011] and many observational studies [@tashiro2023; @jestin2021; @risum2020; @valiante2023] have failed to provide evidence of a clear dose-response relationship with L-AMB dosing and mortality in invasive mucormycosis. Indeed, the Global guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mucormycosis produced by the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) recommend a broad initial dosing range of 5-10 mg/kg/day [@cornely2019].

This uncertainty regarding the optimal dosing of L-AMB is clinically important as higher doses could carry increased risks of nephrotoxicity and infusion-related reactions without definitive evidence of improved survival [@jeong2019]. In this review, we critically evaluate the pharmacokinetic, preclinical, and clinical evidence supporting dose escalation, examine patient-specific factors that may influence the benefit-risk ratio of higher doses, and provide practical recommendations for individualizing L-AMB dosing in invasive mucormycosis.

## Pharmacodynamics and toxicodynamics of liposomal amphotericin B

Amphotericin B (AMB) is a polyene macrolide antifungal agent with broad-spectrum activity against most clinically relevant fungi. Its amphiphillic structure renders it insoluable in body fluids and and neutral pH. The primary mechanism of action of amphotericin B has long thought to involve binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, forming transmembrane channels that disrupt membrane integrity and cause lethal ion leakage, particularly of potassium. However, more recent studies using solid-state NMR suggest amphotericin B forms extramembraneous aggregates or sponges that extract ergosterol from the fungal cell wall [@anderson2014; @lewandowska2021].

Amphotericin B exhibits concentration-dependent killing and prolonged post-antifungal effects in yeast and molds, supporting infrequent dosing regimens [@andes2001; @wiederhold2006]. The liposomal formulation of amphotericin B encapsulates the antifungal in unilamellar vesicles, reducing drug interaction with mammalian cell membranes while enhancing tissue distribution and reducing toxicity compared with conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate [@groll2019].

Relatively few studies have explored the pharmacodynamics of escalating L-AMB doses
